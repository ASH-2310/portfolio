# Projects
## [1. Sports Analytics Project](https://github.com/ASH-2310/Sports-Analytics-Project)
*(Performance & Win Forecast for Oakland Athletics using Linear & Logistic Regression)*
### Value Creation 
>**Data-Driven Decision Making:** Demonstrated the power of data-driven decision making by applying advanced statistical techniques to optimize team performance and resource allocation.\
>**Innovative Approach to Player Evaluation:** Pioneered a novel approach to player evaluation by utilizing advanced metrics and statistical models, challenging traditional scouting methods.\
>**Cost-Effective Strategy:** Successfully implemented a cost-effective strategy to build a competitive team by identifying undervalued players and exploiting market inefficiencies.\

>**Real-World Impact:** Contributed to the success of a real-world sports organization by providing actionable insights that improved team performance and decision-making.
### Findings 
Based on my analysis, Oakland would need following figures in order to make it to the playoffs 
* **Runs Scored = 827**
* **Runs Allowed = 604**
* **Runs Difference = 223**
* **Wins = 103**
  
*According to our model, teams with atleast 103 wins have 97% chances of getting in the playoffs.*\
This graph depicts runs scored vs wins with non-playoff teams in red, playoff teams in green & historical performance of oakland atheletics in yellow.
