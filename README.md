### Findings 
Based on my analysis, Oakland would need following figures in order to make it to the playoffs 
* **Runs Scored = 827**
* **Runs Allowed = 604**
* **Runs Difference = 223**
* **Wins = 103**
  
*According to our model, teams with atleast 103 wins have 97% chances of getting in the playoffs.*\
